LED-Cube is a collection of hardware, firmware and software for an 8x8x8 
sized single-colour LED cube. The project is based off an Instructables
article at: http://www.instructables.com/id/Led-Cube-8x8x8/

The hardware design is based off the design in the above instructable,
but uses some different components, and is designed to work with an
Arduino (ATmega2560). 

The hardware schematics were designed with TinyCAD.

The firmware for the ATmega2560 is written in C (compiled with avr-gcc), 
and was written using the eclipse IDE. 

The software was written in C++ using Qt and Boost.

To build the firmware, you'll need:
	- avr-gcc 
	- eclipse (optional)

To build the software, you'll need:
	- Qt SDK 1.1
	- Boost 1.46.1
